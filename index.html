		<p>Honey /ˈhʌni/ is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects.It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation.The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.</p>

		<p>Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar.It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener.Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years.However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism.</p>

		<p>People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection.Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns,the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive.Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value.Honey is generally safe,but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs.</p>

		<p>Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.</p>
